This is my code repo for the Python for Everybody (PY4E) course by Dr. Charles Severance. 

I compiled each assignment into a single program called "assignments.py" which can be found in the "lessons" folder. Using this program, you can navigate through each assignment via the command line. 

Users are prompted for the chapter number then are returned the chapter name as well as further instructions. The user is ultimately provided with a description of that assignment-program's functionality, and the execution of the code. 

Course started 2022-08-25 and finished 2022-09-12.

1st of 43 Open Source Society University courses completed.
